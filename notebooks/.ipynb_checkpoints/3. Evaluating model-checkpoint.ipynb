Essentially I set up entire networks on my own rig and then go in and play around with them, all from one computer. It takes a lot of processing power and hard drive space.\\n\\nOver the years I've built up several stereotypes about different brands, operating systems, products... Recently, my mind has been opened back up and I'm willing to take a look at anything, even a Dell or an Asus.\\n\\nIt's recently been brought to my attention that Macs are actually pretty good. I've always been a notorious Windows-only-guy. I finally decided to bite my tongue and take a look under the hood, and my god are these things powerful... I guess it really does help making everything but the processor in-house.\\n\\nAnywho, what I really need is suggestions that might work well for my major, hopefully staying under a budget of $1600.

Here's my situation:\\n\\nAbout 10 years ago as I was traveling, I applied for my first credit card which was an AMEX delta card. For the years after, I traveled often, and got benefits from this card.\\n\\nNow, after I have recently graduated college, and landed a full time job, I no longer have time to travel as much, and therefore have no need to use the Delta card. Last year I paid off my balance with the card, and haven't used it since.\\n\\nRecently, I had to pay the $95 annual fee, and realized that I should perhaps consider another credit card. I thought about closing this account and applying for a cash rewards card.\\n\\nNow my issue is that this is my ONLY and OLDEST credit card account. I would like to close the account and apply for a Bank of America cash rewards card as my checking/savings accounts are with them. However, I am concerned with how this will affect my credit report.\\n\\nWill closing this account greatly affect my credit score?\\n\\nI even spoke with the reps at AMEX about downgrading to a cash rewards card with no annual fee, and apparently I cannot do this as my AMEX card is linked with the Delta account. I do not want this card, I'm stuck in a pickle...\\n\\nAny advice would be appreciated! [summary]:</td>\n",

My country's equivalent to Valentine's Day is coming and I had this pretty simple idea to surprise my girlfriend and it would involve giving her some roses.

Any ideas on how to get that information out of her? [summary]:    \n",
       "1  Summarize in less than 50 words.\\n\\n\\nFor most of high school, I've been the go to \"computer kid.\" I'll be the first to admit that I know a lot about how computers work, and often fix things for teachers before the IT guys have a chance to get a whack at them. I worked at a computer repair shop for half a year as a technician. I've done the typical tech guy thing and drooled over new computers that come out (read: Wired/PopSci/2600 articles and centerfolds). \\n\\nThat said, I have NO IDEA what kind of computer to get for college. I've always wanted to buy a ton of parts and build my own \"super\" desktop, but I for sure need a laptop. If everything goes according to plan, I'm enrolling at Champlain College next Fall to double major in Computer Network Information Security and Digital Forensics. \\n\\nA lot of you probably already know this, but this major involves a lot of virtual desktops. Essentially I set up entire networks on my own rig and then go in and play around with them, all from one computer. It takes a lot of processing power and hard drive space.\\n\\nOver the years I've built up several stereotypes about different brands, operating systems, products... Recently, my mind has been opened back up and I'm willing to take a look at anything, even a Dell or an Asus.\\n\\nIt's recently been brought to my attention that Macs are actually pretty good. I've always been a notorious Windows-only-guy. I finally decided to bite my tongue and take a look under the hood, and my god are these things powerful... I guess it really does help making everything but the processor in-house.\\n\\nAnywho, what I really need is suggestions that might work well for my major, hopefully staying under a budget of $1600. Also, what are the big differences between a MacBook and  MacBook Pro? [summary]:    \n",

So far I've applied to nearly 50+ places, 4 recruiters contacted me and added me to their available candidates list after a small interview (one of them got me a small office assignment but that's over) and gotten two interviews by myself (none of which panned out). I have experience in office software and am pretty well versed in excel (i'd say a little less than advanced but a lot more than proficient) and advanced mathematics. I have a GPA higher than 3 but lower than 3.5 which I don't mention in my resume. Could that be it? \\n\\nI don't understand what I'm doing wrong. So far I've been applying to anything remotely related with data, analysis, finance at entry level but I barely get any response. Data entry and admin assistant positions are no different. I also write cover letters for almost every place. I also don't know many people here since my family isn't really well connected enough for me to have great networking opportunities. I really don't know what to do next. I can't imagine how people applying to over 200-400 places deal with the frustrating and emotionally draining experience. I would really appreciate some advice from recent econ/finance grads or hiring personnel. [summary]:    \n",

Here's my situation:\\n\\nAbout 10 years ago as I was traveling, I applied for my first credit card which was an AMEX delta card. For the years after, I traveled often, and got benefits from this card.\\n\\nNow, after I have recently graduated college, and landed a full time job, I no longer have time to travel as much, and therefore have no need to use the Delta card. Last year I paid off my balance with the card, and haven't used it since.\\n\\nRecently, I had to pay the $95 annual fee, and realized that I should perhaps consider another credit card. I thought about closing this account and applying for a cash rewards card.\\n\\nNow my issue is that this is my ONLY and OLDEST credit card account. I would like to close the account and apply for a Bank of America cash rewards card as my checking/savings accounts are with them. However, I am concerned with how this will affect my credit report.\\n\\nWill closing this account greatly affect my credit score?\\n\\nI even spoke with the reps at AMEX about downgrading to a cash rewards card with no annual fee, and apparently I cannot do this as my AMEX card is linked with the Delta account. I do not want this card, I'm stuck in a pickle...\\n\\nAny advice would be appreciated! [summary]:    \n",
